<h1>Rhiannon Williams</h1>
<br>

<p>Welcome to my webpage for the <b>GEOG5995 module</b>.

I am a new PhD student at the University of Sheffield, researching ways in which data analytics might be used to prevent homelessness.<br><br>

As part of my studies, I have created an <b>Agent-Based Model</b> using Python. The ABM shows the locations of sheep as they move around an environment. As they move, the sheep eat grass in the environment and their store increases, with the loop ending once all the sheep are full. As well as the sheep, the model displays the locations of randomly generated poisionous plants - if a sheep gets too close to the plant, the sheep is sick and their store decreases.<br><br>

When developing the ABM, I tried to think of ways the model might be used <b>in practice</b>. For example, when the model displays a particularly high final amount of grass eaten or high number of sheep poisoned, a farmer might choose to relocate them to a less depleted or dangerous environment.<br><br>

The different stages of my ABM and the documentation for the final version can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/rhiswilliams/python">GitHub repository</a>. The final version is <a href="https://github.com/rhiswilliams/python/blob/master/src/unpackaged/abm/model11_extend.py">Model 11</a>, which uses <a href="https://github.com/rhiswilliams/python/blob/master/src/unpackaged/abm/agentframework_web.py">agentframework_web</a>.</p>
